## How to program it
- With Arduino IDE
- With Visual Studio Code (recommended)
- With ESPHome-Flasher (for pre compiled .bin files, depending on your display)

## Features
- 5 channel PWM Signal generator for the following modes: STD, NOR, SHR, SSR, SUR, SXR
- manual or automatic movement modes
- PWM read function with pulsewidth and frequency display
- PPM, SBUS and IBUS read function
- Oscilloscope for 3.3V RC signals, PWM and PPM signals can be visualized well
- Signal generator on GPIO 26
- Calculator
- P O N G game
- Flappy Birds game
- Settings menu, parameters are stored in EEPROM

## Changelog

## New in v0.16-beta.2:
- No very long beep during WiFi enable / disable anymore
- WiFi symbol shown, if enabled

## New in v0.16-beta.1:
- Wifi can be enabled and disabled without reboot 
- Oscilloscope crashing, if WiFi off: no fix so far, leave WiFi enabled...
- Temporary fix: #define FAST_ADC in 0_general settings.h (only use it, if WiFi is always on)
- Web interface enhanced

## New in v0.16-beta.0:
- Signal generator added on GPIO 26 (frequency setting still buggy, triangle not working)
- Oscilloscope potentially crashing on some devices: bugfix attempt

## New in v0.15.0:
- Much nicer sine curves on the oscilloscope thanks to the new ADC_LINEARITY_COMPENSATION option in "0_generalSettings.h"
- Oscilloscope sampling delay up to 300 Âµs
- Oscilloscope is about 8 times faster now. Allows to analyze 1600 Hz SXR siganls way better
- Frequency and duty cycle averaging in oscilloscope
- Encoder acceleration enlarged
- Battery voltage not actualized during power scale adjustment: bug fixed
- EEPROM factory reset option in settings menu
- Servo endpoints and centerpoint are adjustable in 2 groups: STD, NOR, SHR and SSR, SUR, SXR and saved in EEPROM
- Software version is displayed earlier (after logo)

## New in v0.14.0:
- Oscilloscope added
- BUS & oscilloscope input is on CH 5 now
- Precise frequency counter in PWM impulse read mode added
- fixed PWM impulse read bargraph issues
- SSL servo mode removed, because it was useless
- SSR, SUR and SXR frequencies changed, now working with Sanwa PGS-CL II servo
- Added support for active 3V buzzer on GPIO 4
- Calculator: added power of
- ESP32Servo library removed, repaced with native MCPWM ESP32 functionality. Allows way faster servo timings
- A lot of new servo modes added, names are displayed on screen

## New in v0.13.0:
- Servo Hz setting effective on all servo channels and in automatic mode
- Bug fixed: Automatic mode not working in 560 Hz mode
- Bug fixed: Servo angle wrong in 560 Hz mode
- Bug fixed: progress bar out of range in impulse read mode
- Cleaned up frequency selection code
- Microseconds servo range is now displayed in the servo frequency settings menu
- A little calculator was added

## New in v0.12.0:
- Added a Flappy Birds Game
- Alternative logo optimized

## New in v0.11.0:
- Added a Pong game ;-)
- Ball speed is adjustable in settings

## New in v0.10.0:
- Added encoder acceleration in servo tester mode. Makes the operation very handy. If you want to make bigger servo movements, just rotate the encoder faster!
- Unstable Multiswitch issues because of incompatible espressif 32 board solved, see comments in src.ino

## New in v0.9.0:
- Servo is able to oscillate way faster in automatic mode, speed adjustability improved
- Made sure, there is no language string array pointer overflow, if EEPROM was deleted before
- There are still issues with unstable Multiswitch readings. Solution for now: use the pre compiled bin files or use Arduino IDE 2.0.3 with espressif 32 board 2.0.5 (which is unfortunately incompatible with VS Code)

## New in v0.8.0:
- Support for calibrated analogRead, using the ESP32AnalogRead library is improving battery monitoring
- Number of LiPo battery cells is displayed
- Message, if no valid battery is detected
- Support for French language added

## New in v0.7.1:
- ESPHome-Flasher discovered a serious EEMPOM bug, because flash is erased before upload. It should now be fixed.

## New in v0.7.0:
- It is now compatible with VS Code / Platformio. This makes board and library version management way easier, because all is defined in platformio.ini and downloaded automatically. Of course it is still compatible with Arduino IDE
- No external SBUS library required anymore
- Adjustable WiFi power
- Support for alternative logo
- New menu options: 
-- Encoder direction inversed or not
-- SBUS inversed or not
-- Language English or German (others could easily be added)
-- Help text is displayed during start
